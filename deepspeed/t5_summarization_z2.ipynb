    "In this blog, you will learn how to fine-tune [T5-3B](https://huggingface.co/t5-3b) for abstractive summarization with [DeepSpeed](https://www.deepspeed.ai/) using a Habana Gaudi-based [DL1 instance](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/dl1/) on AWS to take advantage of the cost performance benefits of Gaudi. We will use the Hugging Faces Transformers, Optimum Habana and Datasets library as well as the Habana fork of [DeepSpeed](https://github.com/HabanaAI/DeepSpeed). We are going to fine-tune fine-tune [T5-3B](https://huggingface.co/t5-3b) using the [Trade the Event](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/trade-the-event-corporate-events-detection) dataset for abstractive text summarization. The benchmark dataset contains 303893 news articles range from 2020/03/01 to 2021/05/06.

    "\n",
    "[DeepSpeed](https://www.deepspeed.ai/training/) is an easy-to-use deep learning optimization software suite that enables unprecedented scale and speed for Deep Learning Training. [DeepSpeed](https://www.deepspeed.ai/) enables you to fit and train larger models on HPUs thanks to various optimizations. In particular, you can use the two following ZeRO configurations that have been validated to be fully functioning with Gaudi:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ZeRO-1, which partitions the optimizer states across processes.\n",
    "* ZeRO-2, which additionnally partitions the gradients across processes so that each process retains only the gradients corresponding to its portion of the optimizer states.\n",
    "\n",
    "These configurations are fully compatible with Habana Mixed Precision and can thus be used to train your model in bf16 precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find more information about DeepSpeed Gaudi integration [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/habana_deepspeed).\n",
