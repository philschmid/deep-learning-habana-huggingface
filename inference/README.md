# BERT Inference with Hugging Face Transformers on Habana Gaudi

This repository contains instructions for getting started with Deep Learning on Habana Gaudi with Hugging Face libraries like [transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index), [optimum](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/index), [datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/index). This guide will show you how to use Habana Gaudi for inference workloads with transforemrs like BERT.

You can take a look at [philschmid.de/getting-started-habana-gaudi](https://www.philschmid.de/getting-started-habana-gaudi) on how to setup your environment. The examples are expected to run on a Habana Gaudi instance.
